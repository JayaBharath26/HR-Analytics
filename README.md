# HR-Analytics
I developed a Power BI dashboard focusing on the analysis of employee presence data. This endeavor was undertaken in collaboration with industry professionals, including a data analytics manager and a co-founder of a data solutions company. The project aimed to leverage real-world data to extract meaningful insights into employee attendance patterns, with a strong emphasis on data-driven decision-making in HR practices.
